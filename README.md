A simple boilerplate for Nuxt 3 projects using DevTools, Tailwind CSS, Prettier, and TypeScript.

## Essentials

[Nuxt Devtools](https://devtools.nuxt.com/) is pre-installed and enabled by default.

[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is preinstalled and preconfigured.

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is included in the project and orders Tailwind classes using the [TailwindCSS Prettier Plugin](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss)

The [Inter Font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) is set by default for the project (included head of `nuxt.config.ts`).

`<Icon name="NuxtIcon" />` is a custom component that can be passed any icon from the [Icones Library](https://icones.js.org/) to render a SVG.
